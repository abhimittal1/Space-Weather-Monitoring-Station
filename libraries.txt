# Space Weather Station - Required Libraries
# For Wokwi Online Simulator
# These libraries are typically pre-installed in Wokwi

# Core Arduino Libraries (built-in)
LiquidCrystal

# DHT Sensor Library
# Install via Library Manager: DHT sensor library by Adafruit
DHT sensor library

# Note: If you encounter any compilation issues, try these alternatives:
# 1. SimpleDHT library (lightweight alternative)
# 2. DHT22 library (specific for DHT22 sensors)

# The following libraries are built into Arduino IDE and Wokwi:
# - Wire.h (I2C communication)
# - SPI.h (SPI communication) 
# - Serial (UART communication)

# Additional dependencies that may be automatically installed:
# - Adafruit Unified Sensor (dependency for DHT library)
